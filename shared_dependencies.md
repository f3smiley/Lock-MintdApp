Shared Dependencies:

1. Node.js, Solidity, Web3.js, React: These are the main technologies used across all files for development.

2. Contract Addresses: The addresses of the deployed TokenLocker and SyntheticToken contracts will be shared across the JavaScript files and React components to interact with the contracts.

3. Contract ABIs: The ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) of the TokenLocker and SyntheticToken contracts will be shared across the JavaScript files and React components to interact with the contracts.

4. Function Names: The function names lockETH(), mintTokens(), and updateValue() will be shared across the JavaScript files and React components to call these functions.

5. Event Names: The event name TokensLocked will be shared across the JavaScript files and React components to listen for this event.

6. DOM Element IDs: The IDs of DOM elements in the React components (like 'token-balance', 'total-supply', 'token-value', 'lock-tokens', 'mint-tokens', 'burn-tokens') will be shared with the JavaScript files to update these elements.

7. Message Names: The names of messages emitted by the contracts (like 'TokensLocked', 'TokensMinted', 'TokensBurned') will be shared across the JavaScript files and React components to display these messages to the user.

8. Chainlink Oracle: The address and ABI of the Chainlink oracle will be shared across the SyntheticToken contract and the JavaScript files to get the latest ETH/USD price.

9. Test Names: The names of the tests in the test files (like 'TokenLocker.test.js', 'SyntheticToken.test.js', 'lockETH.test.js', 'mintTokens.test.js', 'updateValue.test.js') will be shared with the corresponding JavaScript files and contracts to test these files.

10. Documentation Names: The names of the documentation files (like 'Introduction.md', 'TechnicalArchitecture.md', 'InteractingWithDapp.md', 'FutureImprovements.md', 'Deployment.md', 'UsageGuide.md') will be shared with the corresponding parts of the dApp to document these parts.
