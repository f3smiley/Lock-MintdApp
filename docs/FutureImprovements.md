# Future Improvements

While the current version of the dApp provides a solid foundation for minting synthetic tokens, there are several areas where we could expand and improve the functionality in future iterations:

## Add More Token Types

Currently, the dApp only supports locking and minting tokens for ETH. In the future, we could expand this to include other types of tokens. This would involve modifying the `TokenLocker` and `SyntheticToken` contracts to handle multiple types of tokens, and updating the frontend to allow users to select the token type.

## Use Chainlink VRF for Random Token Distributions

Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) provides a secure and provably fair source of randomness that could be used to implement random token distributions. This could add an element of chance to the token minting process, potentially making it more engaging for users.

## Implement Staking Rewards for Locked Assets

To incentivize users to lock their assets, we could implement a staking rewards system. Users who lock their assets could earn rewards over time, which could be paid out in synthetic tokens or another token of choice. This would involve adding additional functionality to the `TokenLocker` contract to track locked assets over time and calculate rewards.

## Improve Oracle Integration

While the current integration with the Chainlink oracle provides accurate price data for ETH, there may be room for improvement. For example, we could explore using multiple oracles to get a more accurate average price, or implement a fallback mechanism in case the primary oracle fails.

## Enhance User Interface

While the current React frontend provides a basic interface for interacting with the contracts, there is always room for improvement in terms of usability and design. Future updates could include a more intuitive user interface, better error handling, and more detailed information about transactions and token values.

## Increase Test Coverage

While the current test suite covers the main functionality of the contracts and JavaScript functions, there may be edge cases or rare scenarios that are not currently tested. Increasing the test coverage could help catch potential issues before they become problems in a live environment.

These are just a few ideas for future improvements. As with any software project, the possibilities for expansion and enhancement are virtually limitless.
